<p>
I spend a lot of time reading books and papers and sometimes watching videos and I get a lot out of them, but often my memory is so poor that I can't point out the exact thing I learned after a year or two. I think documenting the things that I read/study will provide a lot of value to myself, and maybe to you as well.
