<h2>Why the Interest?</h2>
<p>Cobol, to me, seems really very interesting just because it's so <i>old</i>. This thing has been maintaining banks since before I was born, and probably will continue todo so for another 20-30 years minimum. And despite the huge importance, basically no one knows how to do it anymore. Everyone who can do it is basically retirement age!</p>
