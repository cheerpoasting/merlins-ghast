<h2>Programming and Coding</h2>

<p>Some types of education are just for personal curiousity or well-roundedness. Others are more oriented towards finding employment. I think coding and programming is somewhere between the two: some are hobbiests, some are just focused on their careers, but generally people find it appealing for both reasons.</p>

<p>I've been working on a resource you can check out if you want to <a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/education/coding/coding">learn how to build your own website</a>. Basically, I'm documenting my journey, what I've learned, and tricks that I found.</p>

<p><span class="green-pill">FRESH</span> 
I've recently developed an interest in COBOL and <a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/education/coding/cobol">all the information I've found about COBOL you can find here</a>. I now have a working windows computer, so I'll be able to work along with a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/free-course-announcing-learning-cobol-programming-with-vscode/" target="_blank">16 hour free Cobol course from IBM</a> that I found and I will be <a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/reviews/coding/ibm-cobol-vscode">documenting it here</a>. </p>

<h2 id="memorization">Memorization<span class="green-pill">FRESH</span></h2>
<p>I've been working on a memory experiment through memorizing pokemon, meant to leverage my pre-existing knowledge, and so show that pre-existing knowledge can be leveraged very well simply through testing effect -- you brain begins to surface your pre-existing knowledge because it starts to realize that these things are important to you. There is a similar concept in speedrunning, called "derusting".</p>
