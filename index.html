<h1><img src="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Assets/pokemon-thing-sarcofagus.png" alt="scary pokemon" style="float:left;">Beware All Who Enter Here</h1>

<p>Merlin's Ghast inhabits this place, creating strange and eerie effects upon the land. Beware the bog and the will'o'wisps. Do not touch St. Elmo's fire or the small ship taking you through this place may catch fire. </p>

<p>Only a few islands have emerged in this accursed place; clicking on sootie or his candy will always bring you back home if you get lost.</p>

<h2>Experience so far<img style="float:right;"  src="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Assets/pokemon-thing-teakettle.png" alt="tea kettle"><img style="float:right;margin-top:15px;" src="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Assets/pokemon-thing-teacup.png" alt="teacup"></h2>
<p>I've learned so much in the last 2 weeks creating this website. I was inspired by one YouTube video! It's amazing how something so small can really change your life.</p><p>I had really gotten happy without how my website was looking, and was pushing myself to try to recreate the designs of others, to make sure I understoond how. I managed to make a neutral-bear layout pretty well, but when I was doing a pink axolotl layout I made an amazing menubar and I just HAD to put it on my frontpage!!!</p><p>Well, the issue with that is I hadn't written things very well, so when I was editing it into my homepage, I ended up breaking nearly the entire site. It looks so bad now T.T</p><p>I don't have a copy of my old CSS saved anywhere either, since I make "hot edits" to the website (that's why it says I've made like 5K edits). I kind of want to switch back to my old layout, but that's gonna require a LOT of work, unfortunately. I have to recreate it from nothing.</p><p>But, at the same time, I have learned SO MUCH that the whole website needs to be overhauled again anyway. I'll continue like I have before, just one section at a time, without rushing. There are already way too many pages to rush around updating them all every 5 seconds, and I'm sure I'll learn more as time goes on. The biggest thing I've learned though: my homepage should have a different stylesheet than all my other pages!!!</p>

<h2>Navigation Philosophy<a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Home/navigation"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Folding_Map_Flat_Icon_Vector.svg" alt="map" style="float:right;height:45px;"></a></h2>

<p>The philosophy for navigating this website is shaped heavily by the fact that it's a static site. If you are new to the website, I heavily suggest that you visit the <a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Home/navigation">navigation</a> page for more information on how it works so that you can really enjoy this website to the fullest extent possible, and to prevent frustrations.</p>
