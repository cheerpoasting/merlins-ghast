<h1> &nbsp;Academics <img src="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Assets/purple-boba.gif" alt="purple boba" style="float:left;height:30px;"></h1>

<p><strong>Health.</strong> Due to ill health, I barely graduated High School, and wasn't able to complete University, which is a real blow. My goal in life was always to be either a research or academic, so this absolutely pulverized my self-image. I was really depressed for a while, to the point where I qualified for disability. </p>
<p>But, at some point I realized that I could just learn whatever I wanted, I didn't need "permission" from anyone to do it. Personally, I'm not a big fan of self-directed study for subjects that you don't know well, and I think teaching yourself anything really sucks. My husband is really positive about things like ChatGPT but in general I've found it to be not very good. I'm not sure what the difference is between my experience and his, but I just seem to have a fundamentally different reaction than he does. He also thinks that teachers are pointless and using disconnected internet resources is the way to go. </p>
<p>I think it points to a fundamental psychological difference between the two of us, as representitives of completely different groups of people. It's only because of my respect for him that I even take this position seriously. But I still feel that for most people, they do need a teacher to help them and to explain things to them when they don't even really know what questions to ask.</p>
<p><strong>But I think I've gotten kind of off-topic a bit. </strong>I do a lot of reading in the subjects which I enjoy, and I am trying to struggle my way into a few other topics besides. I think between my notes and various different essays that I write, that I generate probably about 1 Million words per year. Unfortunately, a lot of those words go to projects which are never finished. However, I think this website will be a good place to share them.</p>
<p>And so, that's what I'll be doing in this section, for the most part. Sharing what I've learned about various topics, and writing half-finished essays, and so on.</p>
