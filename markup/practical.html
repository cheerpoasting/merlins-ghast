<h1> Practical Things </h1>

<p> I think it's fair to say that some interest are more "practical" than others. I think I would describe the difference between the academic and practical section in this way: "academic" is things that I just have interest in because I find them interesting (tautological, I know), while practical are things that I have in interest in mainly due to the fact that I would like to impliment the things I learn in my daily life.</p>

<h2>Parenting, Pregnancy, & Homeschooling</h2>

<p> One of my big things is wanting to be a good mom, as well as homeschooling my children. I don't have a lot of experience with either of those, but they are very important to me going forward, especially since I plan on starting a family soon. For that reason, There will be a lot of difference sections on things like conception, pregnancy, childbirth, parenting, and education. </p>
<p>I want my children to have an education that is both classical and tailored to them specifically, their interests, their strengths and weaknesses. I want them to be well rounded, that is, having a good foundation in all standard subjects (at least a "GED" level) but I want them to be strong in the subjects they excel at and ones they are interested in, without overly focusing on things that they dislike or are weak at.</p>

<h2>Self-Education and Lifestyle</h2>

<p>I'm always interested in learning, and having a good lifestyle. So there will be sections for things like how to study, how to organize information, writing advice, recipes and cooking information, cleaning and housekeeping, exercise information, and other things like this. I'm very interested in this kind of stuff, it's really a hobby of mine, and though I've considered it pretty silly for a long time, I really don't think that there's anything wrong with it really.</p>

<h2>Other stuff?</h2>

<p>I really don't remember what else I was originally planning on including (I had a whole list) but I'm sure there are some other things as well. I'm leaving this section here just to remind me that there was probably something else that I was thinking of.</p>
