<h1>Navigation Philosophy</h1>

<p>While most modern websites are dynamic websites, this one is static. The difference between those two is very important. Dynamic websites, they type we are all used to change while we use them, loading different parts from databases and displaying the to us when we ask for them. Things like headers and navigation bars are written only once, and each different page loads them up from the same file. </p>
<p>By contrast, a static webpage like this one defines all of the headers and footers for each individual page, meaning that if you want to update a link in the header, you need to go and edit each individual file. That could be dozens of pages, or even hundreds for a really large website!</p>

<h2>Main Header</h2>
<p>For that reason, I've decided to use an "onion" or "rabbit hole" model for the links on my website. Basically, this means that to start navigating the website, you'll pick a general topic from the menu bar at the top of all of the pages. This will take you to various landing pages which will help you to navigate deeper.</p>

<h3>The Major Sections</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Merlin's Ghast</dt>
<dd>This section includes all of the basic information about the website, what it is, and how it functions. Here, you can find information about me the <a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Home/about">webmaster</a> and why I wanted to create this account, learn about <a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Home/changelog">recent updates</a>, or even take a look behind the curtain and <a href="https://merlins-ghast.neocities.org/Home/maintenance">see how I maintain the website</a>!</dd>

<dt>Blogs</dt>
<dd>This section is just a collection of writing, such as diary entries or musings or rants that are specific to various "moods". While I explain it in more detail on the blog landing page, basically, I get in certain "moods" where I think about the world differently, and sometimes these differences in worldview or approach can be so striking and disorienting that it almost feels like they are opinions from different people. I also have a microblog experiment, which is partially an attempt to replace twitter for quick or "hot" takes what I feel compelled to share, but that I haven't thought through much, if at all.</dd>

<dt>Academic</dt>
<dd>This section is basically fragments of research and (partial) articles of a factual nature. Things like linguistics or sociology that are more informative than actionable. I like these things, sometimes even when I can't explain why. I'm considering using a "wikilike" style for these sections, so show that they are more serious when compared to my more casual and fun webpage design.</dd>

<dt>Practical</dt>
<dd>This section is based on information that I actually plan to use in my daily life, such as culinary theory, housekeeping routines, educational resources, or parenting advice. While these sections may also contain research or be informative, their main purpose is to be functional-- to be capable of being applied to daily life, rather than just idle academic interest (which would be found in the Academic section).</dd>

<dt>Review</dt>
<dd>This section is for talking about media I've watched, things I've read, music I've listened to, or products I have tried. I've been frustrated by the lack of ability to review many different types of things all in one place. While having a full database would be nice, I don't know anything about website backends, and besides, NeoCities doesn't support that kind of functionality natively. In the future, I might be able to get a domain and a server, and migrate part of my website there, moving back and forth between it and the main NeoCities interface. But for now, I use it to keep notes and remarks and reviews of all the various different media I consume, because I find I often want to refer back to different resources, or I have a bad habit of abandoning things partway through that I actually do have a real desire to read. When works are very long, this often leads to a cycle of re-reading the beginning section multiple times but never actually making it to the end of the book. Additionally, many of the things I read aren't especially well documented online, so other people might enjoy this resource.</dd>

<dt>Various</dt>
<dd>This section is for various odds and ends. There are a lot of other things that I don't think really fit well into other sections. And, since I don't know what I might be interested in learning about or sharing in the future, like maybe news or something (idk) I decided to make this section as a sort of catch-all for things that I honestly really don't know where to put them, though maybe I will move them again later, I don't know.</dd>

<dt>Special</dt>
<dd>This section is for things that have a special place in my heart, even if maybe they could go in some other section. For example, my academic research on Christianity would be in the Academic section, things about Christian living would be in the Practical section, but things about my personal (heretical) religious beliefs would be in this special section, as well as detailed discussions of my worldview and systems of ethical and moral evaluation, as well as fun things like internet shrines and so on. My book projects will likely also be stored here.</dd>
</dl>

<h2> Landing Pages</h2>

<p>So each of the buttons on the main header leads to landing pages devoted to that general topic. On the left hand side is a navigation panel that leads to more granular topics. What exactly these links are pointing to, and more information about the section in general will be found on the landing page. </p><p>At this initial stage of the website, often this landing page is all that exists, and I'll just be putting most information directly on that page until it gets quite long. After enough information is accumulated about any specific topic, it will be moved to one of the subpages listed on that left nav bar.</p>

<h2> Subpages </h2>

<p>So, as information on the landing pages gets expanded and some topic reaches a critical mass, it will be moved to a subpage. Subpages, in general, will always link back to the page that they came from, however the left-nav generally won't have any of the links that the upper page had. Instead, it will contain links to related concepts and, as the subpage expands beyond what should realistically fit on one page, it will develop sub-pages of it's own. </p><p>This pattern will continue <em>ad infinitum</em>, creating deeper and deeper rabbit holes that develop organically over the lifetime of the website.</p>
