<p> One of the largest online communities dedicated to solving sudoku and other pencil puzzles is the CtC Discord, named after a YouTube channel "Cracking the Cryptic", which was originally dedicated to solving cryptics crosswords, however evolved into a channel mainly known for solving difficult and variant sudoku puzzles.</p>

<h3>Where can I find Sudoku Puzzles?</h3>
<p>While there are many places dedicated to sudoku puzzles, the best place to find fresh and challenging puzzles it probably either on the CtC Discord, or on LMD -- though LMD is not a site orginally dedicated to sudoku, but instead was a German puzzle club.</p>

<h2>Getting Back Into Sudoku</h2>
<p>I love antiknight sudoku puzzles, and have played hundreds of hours of them. I thought it might be fun to share some of them with you! I haven't played in a long time, but I thought it would be fun to share them with you as I go through solving them again.</p>
