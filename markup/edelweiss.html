<h1> Edelweiss </h1>

<p><a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Edelweiss/3540493828" target="_blank">Edelweiss</a> is a Hungarian psychadelic occult rock band known for their smooth sound and controversial Nazi imagery. Due to the topics covered in their songs, and the shocking artwork on their albums, they are banned from Spotify, though they can be found on YouTube, hosted by Death Fetish. Not much is known about the band members, but rumor has it that the singer only records when he's on psychadelics. </p><p>As far as I know, the band does not have any social media, but they can be contacted <a href="mailto:edelweissband@hotmail.com">via email</a>.<p>

<p><strong>Rating: 10.1</strong> -- This is one of my favorite bands, and I love them SO MUCH, but due to the themes and imagery, like talking about the Gestapo and prominent schwastikas on the albums, I can't really share them with anyone. Their sound is so smooth, and their melodies are so haunting, but I always feel scared that if I share my love for this band with other people, people will get the wrong idea about me.</p>

<p>Beyond the blue horizon, far above the clouds<br>
In a land that no-one knows, live four or five magicians<br>
Who spend their days casting wonderful spells<br>

Write some fortune<br>

In a certain way I feel this song is very romantic, in a sort of Romeo & Juliet way. But I always find these kinds of themes romantic. There's something kind of wrong with me in that way I think. </p><p>I originally gave this song a much lower score, but then it got stuck in my head and I'm loving it much more.

<p>I promised you the great secret<br>
And I will not disappoint you<br>
Is this the end of our adventure?<br>
Nothing has an end</p>

<p>Get out<br>
You have to get in to get out<br>
Kill yourself<br>
And get back your life<br>
Resurrect and be mine<br>
Your eyes are twinkling in the night</p>

<p>Your soul wandered with mine<br>
Together, you and I<br>
Escape the light and fly<br>
I am cursed<br>
I am cursed<br>
Without you I die tonight</p>

<p>Vanish in the sky<br>
Let me die<br>
Or please be mine<br>
You have to get out<br>
From yourself<br>
Deep in my mind(?)</p>

<p>Your soul wandered with mine<br>
Together, you and I<br>
Escape the light and then fly<br>
Oooh, I'm cursed<br>
Oooh, I'm cursed<br>
Without you I die tonight! Tonight!</p>

<td><p>As always, the first song is good. I don't feel it's as good as a lot of their other tracks, though the internet leads me to believe that it is one of their most beloved tracks.</p><p>I wonder if its just a factor of me having listened to it too many times. I used to go crazy for this song, so I'll rate it based on my memory of listening to it on loop for days. I guess I feel the synth should go harder like it does on Night of the Long Pipes (album).</p>

<p>We are riding through the night<br>
Chasing to achieve the light<br>
The way is full of pain<br>

While smoke leaving my breath<br>
Never know what is on<br>
Just drifting all alone</p>

I know that I want some more<br>
Am I gone or am I home<br>

There is no way out in the night of the long pipes<br>
You are all alone in this foggy world now<br>
All, beware of shadows in the night of the long pipes</p>

<p>In the morning you came back<br>
Even though they mixed your death<br>
Try to hold onto something<br>

Is your only ways<br>
Will I ever return here<br>
Or should I be free?</p>

<p>In the opening seconds there is a very real <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPU8OAjjS4k" target="_blank">Kryptonite</a> vibe. Not in a derivative way, but instead they probably grew up listening to this song.</p>

<p>What we are now, so was the dead once before<br>
What the dead is, we will soon become<br>
There is no magic, there is no help<br>
We all wonder:</p>
 
<p>How will I die?<br>
How will I die?<br>
How will I die?</p>
 
<p>Our day will come, no matter where or who you are<br>
The scythe of death won't let you run too far<br>
Poor and rich, saint or a nasty bitch<br>
Fearing the question: How will I die?</p>
 
<p>"??? finale of everything, euh, but ??? do you want looking for to defeat the french, that is a head, that he lives!" (????)</p>

<p>How will I die?<br>
How will I die?<br>
How will I die?<br>
How will I die?</p>

<td><p><strong>CW: Suicide.</strong> The keyboard/synth is reminding me of some band but I really can't remember. I really relate to all of the death and suicide themes of this band. </p>
<p><i>Dying is easy, comfortable</i>: at some point in depression, thinking about suicide just seems so comfortable. </p>
<p><i>Still I want you, even if I suffer</i>: My first love was like this. I was obsessed with her, and would have done anything to be with her, though she had no interest in me. </p>
<p><i>Why can't you just take a look deep in my eyes</i>: I would love to listen to an entire song in this style.</p>
<p>In the second half of the song you can feel a strong surf influence.</p>

<p>I can not take it anymore<br>
Dying is easy, comfortable<br>
No one prepared me for my life<br>
I beg you, take me into the night</p>

<p>Blow my sorrow away<br>
Send me on my way<br>
Blow my sorrow away<br>
Master, show me the way<br>
Blow my sorrow away<br>
I'm ready to die in your name</p>

<p>The time is melting, all around me<br>
You can not please me, just mesmerize me<br>
Most don't know what you have to offer<br>
Still I want you, even if I suffer</p>

<p>Why can't you just take a look deep in my eyes<br>
I just ask for you to guide me sweetly in the night <br>
Can you please just come to me and blow my sorrow away<br>
The only thing I really need is you if I'll have to pray</p>

<p>You tear me to pieces, without mercy<br>
My body's empty, my soul left behind me<br>
Attached to nothing, I'm all alone<br>
Only a shadow far from home</p>

<p>Blow my sorrow away<br>
Send me on my way<br>
Blow my sorrow away<br>
Master, show me the way<br>
Blow my sorrow away<br>
I'm ready to die in your name<br>
Blow my sorrow away<br>
Blow my sorrow away</p>

<p>Blow my sorrow away<br>
Blow my, blow my sorrow away<br>
My ??? sorrow away<br>
Blow my, blow my sorrow away<br>
Sorrow away<br>
Blow my sorrow away<br>
Blow my, blow my sorrow away<br>
Blow my sorrow away<br>
Blow my, blow my sorrow away</p>

<p><strong>CW: Suicide.</strong> Reading the lyrics, it's interesting how many songs are about a kind of obsessive and unhealthy love. You would think, given the iconography that the band chooses, that they would be more rough and more violent. But the first stanza of this song really brings forward that "doomed relationship" line that runs through a lot of their music.</p>
<q>One day I'll die and I will leave you right here, You will think of me and feel for me like you never did before</q> <p>Basically, he feels that she won't truly love him until he kills himself.</p>

<p>[QUOTE: "Matango / Attack of the Mushroom People" (1963)]<br>
If I was really in love with her<br>
I should have eaten the mushrooms with her<br>
And become one<br>
At least we would have been together<br>
But I came back</p>

<p>I start to feel that we are drifting away (day by day)<br>
I feel our feeling starts to be a lot like night and day<br>
We are all feeling tough<br>
Until the point when life starts feeling real<br>
I know you want the rest of it<br>
I wish I could close my eyes<br>
So I wouldn't feel the pain I feel<br>
When I see your eyes</p>

<p>Reality is your biggest fear<br>
Only lies that you want to hear<br>
Until your hope truly dies<br>
Living is easy with closed eyes<br>
Reality is your biggest fear<br>
Only lies that you want to hear<br>
Until your hope truly dies<br>
Living is easy with closed eyes</p>

<p>One day I'll die and I will leave you right here<br>
You will look up to the sky<br>
And see the stars shine up above<br>
I will be one of them<br>
Looking down and watching over you<br>
You will think of me<br>
And feel for me like you never did before<br>
Like you never did before</p>
 
<p>Reality is your biggest fear<br>
Only lies that you want to hear<br>
Until your hope truly dies<br>
Living is easy with closed eyes<br>
Reality is your biggest fear<br>
Only lies that you want to hear<br>
Until your hope truly dies<br>
Living is easy with closed eyes</p>
 
<p>Reality is your biggest fear<br>
Only lies that you want to hear<br>
Until your hope truly dies<br>
Living is easy with closed eyes<br>
Reality is your biggest fear<br>
Only lies that you want to hear<br>
Until your hope truly dies<br>
Living is easy with closed eyes</p>

<td>8.5</td>
<td><p>I can't really decide, but I am thinking that this song is about drug addiction. The name, given the bands iconography, is likely a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht" target="_blank">Kristallnacht</a>, which translates literally as "Crystal Night", and commonly also called "Night of the Broken Glass". </p>
<p>I love the way that it feels though, especially towards the end. I always feel really moved by music, when it has a certain rolling quality. For example, in the second stanza, when he says: <i>It's too, too late, Oh it's too late</i></p>

<p>Misery and empty hopes<br>
It is yours forevermore<br>
To escape this certain fate<br>
Now it's all too fucking late</p>

<p>Oh, onto your soul<br>
You tried to escape your fate<br>
It's too, too late<br>
Oh it's too late<br>
Oh, it's too late<br>
It's too late</p>

<p>When you feel the pain and sorrow<br>
She will come tonight or tomorrow<br>
When you feel alone in the night<br>
She will return, the crystal knight<br>
When you feel distraught and sad<br>
She will come to mess up your head<br>
When you feel hopeless tonight<br>
She will return, the crystal knight</p>

<p>Oh you only want more and more<br>
But you don't know what for<br>
Poisoning your own mind<br>
But the truth you won't find</p>

<p>Oh, onto your soul<br>
You tried to escape the fate<br>
Oh no it's too late, oh it's too late<br>
Oh it's too, too late<br>
It's too late</p>

<p>When you feel the pain and sorrow<br>
She will come tonight or tomorrow<br>
When you feel alone in the night<br>
She will return, the crystal knight<br>
When you feel distraught and sad<br>
She will come to mess up your head<br>
When you feel hopeless tonight<br>
She will return, the crystal knight</p>

<p>Ohh, I miss you crystal knight<br>
I miss you crystal knight<br>
I miss you crystal knight, crystal knight<br>
I miss you crystal knight<br>
I miss you crystal knight<br>
I miss you crystal knight</p>
